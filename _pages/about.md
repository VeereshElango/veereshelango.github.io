[Resume](https://rebrand.ly/veeresh-resume){: .btn .btn--info}


Hi, I am Veeresh. I am a full-time Data Scientist working out of Stockholm in Sweden. Data Scientist is not just my job - it's my passion. I love the feeling of solving problems in a data-driven way.
My love gets extra special while dealing with unstructured data such as text, images and music.

I have been a software developer and corporate trainer for four years back in India.  I enjoy the pleasure of sharing knowledge 
and mentoring aspiring young students. I have given guest lectures for students at Stockholm University during 2018 and 2019.

In this blog, I share my work and contemplations about artificial intelligence and machine learning.
