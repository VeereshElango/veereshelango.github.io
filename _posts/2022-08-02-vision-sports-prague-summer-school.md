> கற்றலின், கேட்டலே நன்று.<br>
> Listening is Better than Learning <br>

<cite> from [Pazhamozhi Naanooru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pa%E1%B8%BBamo%E1%B8%BBi_N%C4%81%E1%B9%89%C5%AB%E1%B9%9Fu) from literature [Pathinen Keezhkanakku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteen_Lesser_Texts)</cite>

Explanation : It is better to hear knowledgeable things from learned men (experienced) than Self Learning.

My father quoted this when I explained him about my idea to attend a summer school. That set the expectation, curiosity and interest about the summer school. 

This [Vision and Sports summer school](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/summerschool2022/index.html) was conducted at Czech Technical University, Prague from 25-30th July, 2022. It is  sponsored by Google and endorsed by [ELLIS society](https://ellis.eu/events/vision-and-sports-summer-school-2022-in-prague) and [ELISE Consortium](https://www.elise-ai.eu/).

The summer school had lectures from the speakers of diverse background within computer vision. In the evening, we were assigned with different sports for all the five days. As like the lectures which were covering basic aspects to state-of-research, the sports sessions also covered the basic drills to intense competitions. 

I would like to share the gist of each lectures in this post.

## Ondrej Chum
***Large scale Image Retrieval and Specific Object Search***

This lecture was started with similar image search in large scale. The different methods to gather features and strategies to match them were followed upon that. Then the challenges associated with image retrieval and techniques to solve them were discussed. Finally wrapped up by discussing about reconstructing 3D reconstruction from single image and querying with night image.

## Christoph Lampert
***Best Practice in Machine Learning for Computer Vision*** 


The lecture started with message of computer vision is not about winning Kaggle competitions but should perform interesting or relevant tasks. The best practices to follow on   solving a computer vision task was explained using five steps sanity checks, defining the problem, collect and annotate data, model training and model evaluation. Also the best practices to follow on scientific scrutiny was also discussed. Finally wrapped with nice take home messages which I like.

***CV/ML for the real world - robustness, confidence, uncertainity, out-of-distribution, domain adaptation and generalization***
